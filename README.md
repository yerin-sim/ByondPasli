SEPS: Semantic-enhanced Patch Slimming Framework for fine-grained cross-modal alignment
We referred to the implementations of LAPS and D2S-VSE to build up the repository. Our paper is at here.

# Introduction
Fine-grained cross-modal alignment constitutes the bedrock of modern vision-language understanding, serving as the pivotal mechanism for establishing precise correspondences between visual regions and linguistic concepts. This alignment capability underpins a wide spectrum of downstream applications, ranging from visual question answering and image captioning to the increasingly demanding task of cross-modal retrieval. As multimodal systems evolve toward granular comprehension, the ability to accurately disentangle and align complex visual scenes with specific semantic cues has become a critical imperative.


Despite significant progress, current alignment paradigms universally encounter a fundamental theoretical bottleneck: \textbf{Semantic Sparsity Bias}. This bias arises from the intrinsic asymmetry between modalities—visual inputs inherently carry dense, continuous, and high-entropy spatial information, whereas textual descriptions (captions) act as sparse, discrete, and low-entropy anchors. In Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, this asymmetry manifests as two persistent challenges: \textit{patch redundancy}, where a vast majority of visual tokens lack explicit textual supervision, and \textit{patch ambiguity}, where the concise nature of sparse text fails to provide sufficient discriminative cues for specific visual regions. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:motivation}(a), a generic caption such as "A woman with a tennis racket" fails to describe the surrounding context or specific visual attributes, leading to the inadvertent suppression of visually vital but textually unmentioned patches during the alignment process.

Recent advancements have sought to leverage Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to augment textual representations. While promising, naive integration of MLLMs often introduces \textit{semantic drift}, where the hallucinated or overly detailed descriptions from MLLMs conflict with the ground-truth sparse captions, creating noise that degrades retrieval precision. Furthermore, conventional alignment metrics typically rely on global mean pooling, which indiscriminately aggregates scores from all patches. This approach is fundamentally flawed in complex scenes, as irrelevant background patches with low similarity scores effectively dilute the contribution of highly aligned foreground regions, obscuring the true semantic correlation.

To address these limitations, we propose the \textbf{Semantic-Enhanced Patch Slimming (SEPS)} framework, a systematic approach designed to resolve the Semantic Sparsity Bias through a novel Dual-Granularity Semantic Calibration (DGSC) mechanism. As shown in Figure 1(b), our key insight is to treat MLLM-generated content not merely as auxiliary text, but as a Holistic Visual-Linguistic Anchor. By integrating this dense anchor with the original sparse queries, we establish a semantic consensus mechanism that cross-verifies visual patches against both discriminative keywords (Sparse) and contextual narratives (Dense).

Functionally, as depicted in Figure 1(a), SEPS operates through a sophisticated pipeline. We first extract multi-view features and employ the DGSC module to identify salient visual patches. Unlike previous methods that filter patches based on single-source supervision, DGSC performs a ``weighted consensus'' process to preserve patches that are relevant to either the specific query or the global context. Subsequently, we introduce the Salience-Guided Metric Aggregation (SGMA) module, which replaces standard mean pooling with a relevance-aware alignment strategy. This ensures that the final similarity score is dominated by the most semantically significant patch-word pairs, making the metric robust to background noise.

Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate that SEPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 23%-86% in rSum across various model backbones, with particularly significant improvements in text-to-image retrieval tasks.


# Preparation
## Environments
We recommended the following dependencies:

- python >= 3.8
- torch >= 1.12.0
- torchvision >= 0.13.0
- transformers >=4.32.0
- opencv-python
- tensorboard
## Datasets
We have prepared the caption files for two datasets in data/ folder, hence you just need to download the images of the datasets. The Flickr30K (f30k) images can be downloaded in flickr30k-images. The MSCOCO (coco) images can be downloaded in train2014, and val2014. We hope that the final data are organized as follows:

data
├── coco  # coco captions
│   ├── coco_testall.jsonl
│   ├── coco_train.jsonl
│   ├── train_ids.txt
│   ├── train_caps.txt
│   ├── testall_ids.txt
│   ├── testall_caps.txt
│   └── id_mapping.json
│

## Model Weights
Our framework needs to get the pre-trained weights for BERT-base, ViT-base, and Swin-base models. You also can choose the weights downloaded by transformers automatically (the weights will be downloaded at ~/.cache).

# Training
First, we set up the arguments, detailed information about the arguments is shown in arguments.py.

- --dataset: the chosen datasets, e.g., f30k and coco.
- --data_path: the root path of datasets, e.g., data/.
- --multi_gpu: whether to use the multiple GPUs (DDP) to train the models.
- --gpu-id, the chosen GPU number, e.g., 0-7.
- --logger_name, the path of logger files, e.g., runs/f30k_test or runs/coco_test
Then, we run the train.py for model training. The models need about 20,000 GPU-Memory (one 3090 GPU) when batch size = 64 and about 40,000 GPU-Memory (one A40 GPU) when batch size = 108. You need to modify the batch size according to the hardware conditions, and we also support the multiple GPUs training. Besides, considering the GPU-memory limitation, we don't integrate the Gumbel-softmax sampling for the patch selection in the repository. The performances are not affected much but GPU-memory is reduced a lot (see more details in the paper).
